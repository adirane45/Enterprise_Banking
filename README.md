Enterprise Banking System v6.0 - Production Ready

üè¶ What This Code Is About
This is a comprehensive Enterprise Banking System implemented in C++ that simulates real-world banking operations with production-level reliability and precision. The system incorporates four critical fixes that make it suitable for actual financial applications.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality
Account Management: Create and manage Savings, Current, and Loan accounts.

Transaction Processing: Deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and EMI payments.

User Authentication: PIN-based security with hashed password storage.

Transaction History: Complete audit trail with UTC timestamps.

File Operations: Persistent data storage with atomic operations.

Configuration Management: Flexible settings through INI files.

Professional Logging: Thread-safe logging system with multiple levels.

‚ú® Key Features & Production Fixes
Critical Fix #1: Monetary Precision

Uses integer-based arithmetic (paise) instead of floating-point.

Eliminates rounding errors in financial calculations.

Safe monetary operations with overflow protection.

Critical Fix #2: UTC Timestamps

All timestamps managed in UTC for geographic reliability.

Consistent time tracking across different time zones.

Proper UTC labeling in all displays.

Critical Fix #3: Enhanced Atomic Operations

Robust error handling with comprehensive file system checks.

Automatic backup and rollback on failures.

Data integrity protection.

Critical Fix #4: Transaction Rollback

Full ACID compliance with transaction management.

Automatic rollback on any transaction failure.

Complete account state restoration capabilities.

üíª System Requirements & Dependencies
Compiler Requirements
C++ Standard: C++17 or higher (requires std::filesystem)

Supported Compilers:

GCC 8.0+

Clang 7.0+

MSVC 2019+

üöÄ How to Deploy and Use
Step 1: Compilation
On Linux/macOS:

Bash

g++ -std=c++17 -pthread -o banking_system enterprise-banking-v6-production-fixes.cpp
On Windows (MSVC):

DOS

cl /std:c++17 /EHsc enterprise-banking-v6-production-fixes.cpp /Fe:banking_system.exe
Step 2: System Initialization
When you run the program, it automatically:

Creates Directory Structure:

data/ - Account and transaction data

logs/ - System logs with UTC timestamps

backups/ - Automatic backups

config/ - Configuration files

Generates Configuration File: config/banking.ini with default settings.

Initializes Logging System: Creates timestamped log files for audit trails.

Step 3: Using the System
Basic Operation:

Bash

./banking_system
The system provides:

Account Creation

Secure Login

Banking Operations

Transaction History

Account Statements

Step 4: Configuration Customization
Edit config/banking.ini to customize settings:

Ini, TOML

[account]
min_account_number=100001
max_account_number=999999
starting_account_number=100000

[security]
max_pin_attempts=3
pin_length=4
min_password_length=6

[transaction]
max_history_per_account=500
large_transaction_threshold=50000
Step 5: Data Management
Account Data: data/accounts.txt

Transaction Logs: data/transactions_[account_number].txt

System Logs: logs/banking_[timestamp]_UTC.log

Backups: backups/

üõ°Ô∏è Production Deployment Considerations
Security: Password hashing with salts and secure PIN validation.

Data Integrity: ACID-compliant transactions with rollback capabilities.

Monitoring: Professional logging system for audit trails.

Scalability: Thread-safe operations support concurrent access.

Reliability: Atomic file operations prevent data corruption.

This system is designed to serve as a robust foundation for banking software, educational purposes, or as a starting point for more complex financial applications requiring production-level reliability and precision.
